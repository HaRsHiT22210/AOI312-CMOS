This project compares the implementation of a logic expression using both complex and non-complex gate designs in Cadence Virtuoso. It analyzes and contrasts the area, delay (Tfall, Trise, Tpd, Tcd), and power (leakage, static, and dynamic) across pre- and post-layout simulations under multiple PVT corners. The study demonstrates that complex logic offers better area and power efficiency, while non-complex logic introduces higher delay and power consumption due to increased transistor count. The repository includes simulation results, waveform snapshots, and layout metrics.
